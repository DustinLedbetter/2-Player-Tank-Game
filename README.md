# Tank-Game-Version-2
This is the second version to "Mini-Java-Game" I made a few years ago. I have rewrote and updated it. It has several new changes from the older build including the use of Canvas as buffer. I also plan to make a few versions after this slowly building a more complex game. The original was made in Eclipse IDE. This one is made using the Netbeans IDE.
