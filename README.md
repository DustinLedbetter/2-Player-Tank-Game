# Tank-Game-Version-2
I have completed this project to get myself reacquainted with coding in Java. It is a mini-game where two players each control a tank and try to destroy each other. I loved making it and already have plans to make several versions more including more functionality each time. This is the second version to "Mini-Java-Game" I made a few years ago. I have rewrote and updated it including several new changes from the older build including the use of Canvas as a buffer and a cache for images to load from. The original was made in Eclipse IDE and this one is made using the Netbeans IDE.
